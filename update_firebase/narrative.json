["<p>Welcome to the CRSG, this is a tutorial level to make sure you know how to play. \nYou can start right away by giving a quick glance to the <strong> GUIDE</strong> to find the errors. \nThen you can review the code.</p>\n <p><strong> When you have found a defect, select the line(s) it is in. Than press the add button in the right corner below.\nIt will be added to your defect list, from there you can select the reason for the defect. </strong></p>\n <p> Remember to make use of your <strong>checklist</strong> and <strong>guide</strong> . If you are not sure about the \n type of defect that you have found or how to select it, you should refer\n back to the guide.\n -Bilsen Team </p>", 
"<p>This level will be your first real taste of the game. It consists of a simple java class written relatively well.\n Still something with this code smells. \n As always, select the error reasons carefully and reasonably in order to get more points. <br /><br /> Source: https://github.com/acarturk-e/CS101-Lab-Assignments/blob/master/lab03/lab03a/Lab03a.java </p>",
"<p>What if some part of the code is missing? A good quality of the code is that it should be self-explanatory. Does the code in the right have this property? <br /><br /> Source: https://github.com/acarturk-e/CS101-Lab-Assignments/blob/master/lab08/lab08/LibraryTest.java </p>",
"<p>Here we have the code that was lacking from the previous work. Do you think it is properly written? <br /><br /> Source: https://github.com/acarturk-e/CS101-Lab-Assignments/blob/master/lab09/lab09a/Library.java </p>",
"<p>And a gift from us! Can you follow the code and check if it does what is expected to do?</p>"]
