      <p>Welcome to the CRSG, this is a tutorial level to make sure you know how to play. You can start right away by giving a quick glance to the <strong> GUIDE</strong>. Than you can review the code.</p>
      <p><strong> When you have found a defect, select the line(s) it is in. Than press the add button in the right corner below.
          It will be added to your defect list, from there you can select the reason for the defect. </strong></p>
       <p> Remember to make use of your <strong>checklist</strong> and <strong>guide</strong> . If you are not sure about the 
          type of defect that you have found or how to select it, you should refer
           back to the guide.
                                                                  -Bilsen Team </p>

        <p>This level will be your first real taste of the game. This level consists of a simple java class
          with code smells and even defects. Go and find them! As always select the error reasons carefully and reasonably in order to
          get more points. 
        </p>

          <p>Thing are getting more serious. In this level you are reviewing a very simple arithmetic operation implemented on 
            arrays however in order to get a high score you need to pay close attention to the operations performed and their 
            validity. 
          </p>
                                                                        
        </ul>
        <ul id="narrativeText4">
            <p> <strong>Congratulations for making it this far! </strong>
              You are now dealing with a program performing matrix operations. While working with matrixes things can always
              go wrong and defect can hide under your nose for a long time. <strong> So be careful. </strong>  
               </p>

             <p>Last level of the experiment is <strong>HERE</strong> and about prime numbers!! </p> 
              <p>
                  PS: <strong>If a line of code is missing you should select the nearest encapsulating object structure, eg the nearest curly brackets, for example if a return statement is 
                      missing inside an "if" statement you should select the whole if statement. The reason of the defect for such cases should be "Data and resource manipulation"</strong>
